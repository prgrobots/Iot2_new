# Session 1: Electronics Fundamentals – Voltage, Current, Ohm’s Law

**Week:** 1  
**Element:** ICTIOT502 Element 2: Test and rectify IoT code  
**Duration:** 3.5 hours  
**Phase:** Electronics for Programmers

## Session Introduction

Welcome to the first week of the RockCore Mining IoT course! In this session, you’ll learn the basics of electronics—voltage, current, resistance, and Ohm’s Law—using the Tinkercad Circuits simulator ([Official Guide](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits)). These fundamentals are essential for building reliable sensor systems for haul trucks. You’ll build a simple series circuit that measures current, and start assembling the truck chassis for hands-on sensor integration in later weeks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Identify voltage, current, and resistance in simple circuits
- Apply Ohm’s Law to calculate values in a circuit
- Use Tinkercad Circuits to simulate basic electronic components
- Begin assembling the truck chassis for future sensor integration
- Document your work for portfolio submission

## 1. Electronics Theory: Voltage, Current, Resistance

Review the basics of voltage, current, and resistance. Use Ohm’s Law ($V = IR$) to solve simple circuit problems. Try the PhysComp interactive lessons (L1–L3).

## 2. Tinkercad Simulation: Building Circuits

Create a new project in Tinkercad Circuits. Build a simple series circuit with a battery, resistor, and LED. Use the built-in ammeter to measure current in the circuit.

## 3. Chassis Assembly

*Chassis assembly will begin in Week 3. For now, focus on building and simulating your series circuit in Tinkercad.*

## 4. Portfolio Checkpoint

- Save screenshots of your Tinkercad circuit
- Take a photo of your chassis assembly
- Write a short reflection: What did you learn about Ohm’s Law?

## Check Your Knowledge

1. What is the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance?
2. Why is it important to use the correct resistor value with an LED?
3. How will these concepts help you build a reliable haul truck sensor system?
