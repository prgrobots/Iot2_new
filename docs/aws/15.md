# Session 15: AWS Industry Quest – Manufacturing & Automotive (Week 1/3)

**Week:** 15  
**Element:** ICTIOT503 Element 3: Deploy complete IoT solution with digital twin  
**Duration:** ~4–5 hours  
**Phase:** Capstone Integration (AWS Industry Quest: Manufacturing & Automotive)

---

## Session Introduction

This week marks the start of **AWS Industry Quest: Manufacturing and Automotive**, a game-based immersive learning environment specifically built for vehicle and equipment telemetry scenarios. Over the next 3 weeks, you'll complete this 13-hour course that covers digital twins, edge-to-cloud architectures, predictive maintenance, and vehicle fleet simulation — directly aligned with the RockCore haul truck scenario.

**This week (Week 15):** Introduction to the Industry Quest, digital twins in AWS IoT TwinMaker, and building your first digital twin model of the 3D-printed haul truck.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 15, you will be able to:

- Understand AWS IoT TwinMaker and digital twin concepts
- Build a digital model of your 3D-printed truck in TwinMaker
- Connect real IoT sensor data to the digital twin
- Visualize live data from physical truck on the digital model
- Prepare for fleet simulation and predictive maintenance labs

---

## Session Structure

1. **AWS Industry Quest: Manufacturing and Automotive** – Labs 1–4 (3–4 h this week)
2. **Digital Twin Modeling** – Create RockCore-Truck-01 in TwinMaker
3. **Sensor Data Binding** – Connect MQTT telemetry to digital twin properties
4. **Real-Hardware Extension** – Capture live data on digital model

## Pre-Session Preparation

!!! info "Required Completion"
    - AWS account with Industry Quest: Manufacturing and Automotive enrollment (you added students to subscription)
    - Haul truck device from Weeks 1–14 publishing to AWS IoT Core
    - SiteWise asset model "RockCore-Truck-01" from Week 14 (optional but recommended)
    - AWS IoT TwinMaker enabled in your region (N. Virginia recommended)

!!! tip "Hardware Check"
    - [ ] Real ESP32 haul truck publishing MQTT telemetry
    - [ ] Sensors functional: temperature, vibration, gas, cabin lock
    - [ ] AWS IoT console shows live messages from truck

!!! warning "Industry Quest Access"
    - Navigate to [AWS Industry Quest](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/)
    - Find "Manufacturing and Automotive" quest
    - Begin labs in order (they build on each other)

## RockCore Mining Context

**Pit Station Enhancement:** Supervisors will soon see not just dashboards, but **3D digital representations** of haul trucks with **live sensor overlays**. This enables:

- Visual anomaly detection (see vibration spikes on the truck model in real-time)
- Predictive maintenance scheduling (trending on visual twins, not just tables)
- Fleet-wide digital simulation (run "what-if" scenarios before deploying changes)
- Training tool (new operators see truck behavior in digital form first)

## AWS Industry Quest: Manufacturing & Automotive (Labs 1–4)

### Overview

This 13-hour quest is **broken across Weeks 15–17**. This week covers:
- **Lab 1:** Introduction to digital twins and AWS IoT TwinMaker
- **Lab 2:** Modeling manufacturing equipment (adapting truck example)
- **Lab 3:** Connecting real-time data sources
- **Lab 4:** Visualizing asset data on digital models

**Expected Progress:** Approximately 3–4 hours of guided labs (some labs are open-ended and may extend into Week 16).

### Real-Hardware Extension

**Your Task This Week:**
1. Complete Industry Quest Labs 1–3 (minimum)
2. Build a digital twin of your **haul truck chassis** in TwinMaker:
   - Name: `RockCore-Truck-01` (matches SiteWise asset name)
   - Geometry: Use a 3D model of your 3D-printed truck (download or create simple box/cylinder primitives)
   - Properties: Temperature (engine), Vibration (base), Gas level, Cabin lock state
   
3. **Bind live data** to the digital twin:
   - Connect TwinMaker to your IoT Core rule or SiteWise asset
   - Configure telemetry feeds from your real truck
   - Verify temperature value appears on the digital model in real-time

4. **Capture a screenshot** showing:
   - TwinMaker dashboard with your truck digital twin displayed
   - Live sensor values overlaid on the 3D model
   - Timestamp confirming real-time update (within last 5 minutes)

---

## Hands-On: Build Your First Digital Twin

### Step 1: Create TwinMaker Scene

**AWS Console → IoT TwinMaker:**

1. Create new **Workspace:**
   - Name: `rockcore-mining`
   - Role: Create new service role

2. Create new **Scene:**
   - Name: `haul-truck-fleet`
   - 3D Model Source: **Matterport Capture** or **Upload 3D Model** (or use bundled models)
   - Alternative: Create simple **primitives** (cube for truck body, cylinder for wheels)

### Step 2: Model Truck Entity

**In TwinMaker:**

```json
{
  "entityId": "RockCore-Truck-01",
  "entityName": "Haul Truck 01",
  "description": "3D digital twin of haul truck with live sensor telemetry",
  "components": {
    "EngineTemperature": {
      "type": "aws:alarm:temperature",
      "properties": {
        "current_temperature": { "value": 0 },
        "threshold": { "value": 65 }
      }
    },
    "Vibration": {
      "type": "aws:sensor:vibration",
      "properties": {
        "vibration_level": { "value": 0 },
        "anomaly_detected": { "value": false }
      }
    },
    "GasLevel": {
      "type": "aws:sensor:gas",
      "properties": {
        "gas_ppm": { "value": 0 }
      }
    },
    "CabinLock": {
      "type": "aws:switch:lockstate",
      "properties": {
        "locked": { "value": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Connect Live Data

**Option A: Via IoT Analytics (if using from Week 14)**
- TwinMaker → Data Connectors → Create connector to IoT Analytics channel
- Map: `temperature` field → `EngineTemperature.current_temperature`
- Map: `vibration` field → `Vibration.vibration_level`

**Option B: Via SiteWise (if created in Week 14)**
- TwinMaker → Data Connectors → Create SiteWise connector
- Select asset: `RockCore-Truck-01`
- Auto-map properties to digital twin components

**Option C: Direct IoT Core (advanced)**
- Use TwinMaker **Custom Connector** (Lambda-based)
- Write Lambda to subscribe to MQTT and push to TwinMaker API

### Step 4: Visualize in 3D Scene

1. In your `haul-truck-fleet` scene, place the truck 3D model
2. Select the model → Assign to entity: `RockCore-Truck-01`
3. Add **overlays** showing:
   - Temperature in top-left corner
   - Vibration as animated bar on truck body (red if > threshold)
   - Gas level as gauge
   - Cabin lock status as icon

4. **Save Scene** and open **Live View**
5. Verify that as you run your truck, values update in real-time

## Troubleshooting

**Q: TwinMaker not available in my region?**  
A: TwinMaker is available in select regions (N. Virginia, Frankfurt, Tokyo). Use N. Virginia if your default region lacks it.

**Q: How do I get 3D models of vehicles?**  
A: Thingiverse and Sketchfab have free haul truck / mining equipment models. Download as `.glb` or `.obj`, then upload to TwinMaker.

**Q: My truck data isn't showing in the digital twin?**  
A: Check that IoT Core rule is routing data to SiteWise/Analytics, and that TwinMaker connector is configured correctly. Test with `aws iot-data publish` to verify message flow.

**Q: Can I use a simple 2D placeholder instead of a 3D model?**  
A: Yes — TwinMaker supports 2D scenes too. For now, a simple rectangle labeled "Truck-01" is acceptable; enhance later.

## What's Next

**Week 16:** Continue Industry Quest (Labs 4–6) — fleet simulation, edge computing scenarios, predictive maintenance algorithms. Integrate truck sensor anomalies with TwinMaker alerts.

**Week 17:** Complete Industry Quest (Labs 7–13) — full manufacturing scenario, vehicle telemetry deep dive, multi-truck simulation, and prepare Capstone final submission.
