A6 grading focuses on end-to-end system integration, not quest completion.</p> <p>Q: Can I submit Capstone without real truck hardware? A: No. A6 requires at least one real ESP32 device publishing live telemetry. You can simulate other trucks, but the \"real\" truck is mandatory.</p> <p>Q: How much time should I spend on pit station web dashboard? A: Minimal viable: 30 minutes (basic HTML grid). Enhanced: 1\u20132 hours (add charts, drill-down, real-time WebSocket updates). Aim for MVP by end of Week 17.</p> <p>Q: What if my TwinMaker scene has performance issues with 6 trucks?
