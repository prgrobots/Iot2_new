| Course Component | Unit & Element Mapped | How It Maps |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Assessment 1: Engine Compartment Monitor | ICTIOT502 Element 2: Program IoT device | Students program the ESP32 to collect data from DHT11 (temperature/humidity), MQ-2 (gas), and flame sensors, implementing threshold-based alerting code in Python/C, including testing and rectification of faults like sensor calibration errors. |
| Assessment 2: Operator Cabin Safety System | ICTIOT502 Element 1: Identify business requirements | Requirements gathering for secure access (e.g., RFID authentication for authorized personnel), selecting hardware like PIR motion sensor and RTC for logging, aligned to mining safety compliance. |
| Assessment 3: Tire & Suspension Health Monitor | ICTIOT503 Element 3: Produce design documentation | Design diagrams and test plans for GY-521 accelerometer and ultrasonic sensor network, documenting compatibility (e.g., I2C bus integration) and evaluation of resources like memory for vibration data processing. |
| Assessment 4: Payload & Load Management | ICTIOT503 Element 2: Evaluate design options and resources | Evaluate servo vs. stepper for dump simulation, assess water level sensor calibration for load accuracy, including scalability for fleet-wide deployment. |
| Assessment 5: Haul Road Environmental Monitor | ICTIOT503 Element 4: Test connectivity and compatibility | Test multi-sensor network (rain, photoresistor, ultrasonic) under simulated conditions (e.g., dust interference), ensuring compatibility with ESP32 GPIO and I2C protocols. |
| Capstone (Assessment 6): Integrated Fleet System | ICTIOT502 All Elements + ICTIOT503 All Elements | Full programming of two devices (truck + pit station), design scoping for AWS integration, testing offline states with Device Shadows, and comprehensive documentation mapping to performance criteria like secure MQTT connectivity and anomaly detection. |
| Weeks 1-9: Electronics Sessions | ICTIOT502 Element 2: Test and rectify IoT code | Progressive testing in Wokwi simulator and real hardware, rectifying faults like debounce issues in buttons or noise in analog signals, building toward reliable IoT code. |
| Weeks 10-14: AWS Sessions | ICTIOT503 Element 1: Scope design options | Scoping AWS architecture for fleet (e.g., Thing Groups for trucks), evaluating options like Greengrass for edge vs. full cloud processing. |
