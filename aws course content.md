### Summary – What you actually give the students

| Resource | Access | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| AWS IoT Learning Plan: Foundations (5 digital courses) | Free | Everyone enrols Week 10 |
| AWS SimuLearn: OTA Updates in Edge Devices | Subscription (you add students) | Required Week 12 |
| AWS SimuLearn: ETL at the Edge | Subscription | Required Week 13 |
| Lab – Deploying AWS IoT Greengrass Components | Free lab | Required Week 13 |
| Connecting Systems and Machines to AWS for Industrial Manufacturing | Free digital course | Required Week 14 |
| AWS Industry Quest: Manufacturing and Automotive (13 h) | Subscription (you add students) | Required Weeks 15–17 – this is the “wow” factor with the 3D digital twin |

### Everything else stays exactly the same
- Weeks 1–9: Pure electronics (Wokwi → real ESP32) using PhysComp + your 3D truck  
- No SimuLearn in first 9 weeks (keeps focus on hardware)  
- All subscription content is only the 3 SimuLearn + 1 Industry Quest listed above (total ~16 h) – perfect amount
